# AI Programming Project

This project is focused on developing AI-based solutions using programming techniques and machine learning models. The aim is to implement cutting-edge AI models to solve real-world problems and explore innovative uses of AI.

## 🚀 Getting Started
```markdown
To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mahesh-vardhan-kanakala/Ai-programing-project.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies
Install all necessary dependencies using npm:
```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Run the project
Start the development server:
```sh
npm start
```

This will start a local server at `localhost:3000`, where you can view the AI model outputs and interact with them.

## 🛠️ Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:
```text
/ ├── public/                  # Static assets like images, icons, and other resources │ └── favicon.ico              # Favicon for the project ├── src/                     # Main source files │ ├── components/             # Reusable UI components │ │ └── ModelCard.js           # Display AI model results │ ├── ai_models/              # AI models and training scripts │ │ └── model.py               # Main AI model implementation │ └── pages/                  # Website pages │ └── index.js                # Home page └── package.json             # Project metadata and dependencies
```

- **`public/`**: Contains static files like images, icons, and favicons.
- **`src/components/`**: Reusable UI components such as `ModelCard` to display results.
- **`src/ai_models/`**: Contains scripts for training and running AI models.
- **`src/pages/`**: Contains the core pages, with `index.js` as the main entry point.
- **`package.json`**: Metadata and dependencies for the project.
