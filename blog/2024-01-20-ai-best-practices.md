# AI Best Practices

AI is an incredible tool, but like any technology, it comes with best practices to ensure effective and efficient usage.

## 1. Understand the Problem Before Applying AI

- AI solutions should be chosen based on problem complexity.
- Identify data requirements before choosing models.

## 2. Keep AI Systems Transparent

- Use explainable AI models where possible.
- Document how AI models were trained.

## 3. Ethical Use of AI

- Avoid biases in AI training data.
- Regularly audit AI systems for fairness and accuracy.

By following these best practices, developers can ensure theyâ€™re using AI responsibly and effectively.
